## How to play

- Hangman is a classic, quick word guessing game perfect to kill some free time or learn a few new words.
- As the user you get the opportunity to choose one of three difficulty levels.
- The object of this solo game is to guess the hidden word before the stick man is hung.
- Gameplay continues until the figure has been hung (after 6 incorrect guesses) or the word has been correctly guessed, one letter at a time.

## User Experience

In this version of Hangman the user is presented with the classic game where each letter of a word is replaced with a dash (hidden word).  The user will need to guess this word one letter at a time. 

With each correct guess the dash within this word updates and displays the letter in the correct position of the hidden word.

The users goal is to guess the correct word before the game ends, this is displayed with a complete hangman stick figure as well as a message to notify the user that he/she has lost the game.
